const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'How much does SEO cost in Cleveland OH?',
    answer:
      'Cleveland SEO services typically range from $1,250 to $3,500 per month depending on sector competitiveness, number of business locations, and technical site condition. FactoryJet operates on month-to-month agreements with no long-term contract lock-ins and starts with a comprehensive free technical audit.',
  },
  {
    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'Why do you offer month-to-month terms instead of 12-month contracts?',
    answer:
      'We believe client retention should be earned through measurable lead generation and ranking improvements rather than legal lock-ins. Month-to-month agreements keep our engineering team accountable to driving real business pipeline every 30 days.',
  },
  {
    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'What hidden fees or setup costs should Cleveland businesses watch out for?',
    answer:
      'Many traditional agencies bill extra onboarding fees, charge separately for basic Google Business Profile setup, or invoice additional hourly rates for technical code adjustments. With FactoryJet, your monthly rate covers complete technical execution, on-page optimization, content production, citation management, and conversion tracking with zero unexpected surcharges.',
  },
  {
    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'How do I compare quotes from different Cleveland SEO companies?',
    answer:
      'Compare deliverables, team seniority, and account ownership. Verify whether technical code fixes are included or billed extra, whether you will speak directly with an engineer or an account manager, and confirm that you retain 100% ownership of your content, code, and analytics data.',
  },
  {
    category: 'local',
    question: 'How do we get our Cleveland business into the Google 3-Pack Map results?',
    answer:
      'Winning the Google Map Pack requires an accurate primary category selection, complete service menus, consistent Name-Address-Phone (NAP) citations, steady customer review acquisition, and high domain authority from a fast, technically optimized website.',
  },
  {
    category: 'local',
    question: 'Can you rank our business in surrounding towns like Lakewood, Beachwood, and Westlake?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We architect dedicated geographic service area landing pages and localized schema markup targeting Greater Cleveland suburbs including Lakewood, Beachwood, Westlake, Strongsville, Parma, Solon, and Mentor.',
  },
  {
    category: 'local',
    question: 'How important are Google reviews for Cleveland local rankings?',
    answer:
      'Google reviews are one of the strongest direct ranking factors for local search. We help your business implement frictionless post-service SMS and email review collection workflows that consistently generate verified 5-star customer feedback.',
  },
  {
    category: 'local',
    question: 'What is the difference between Google Map Pack SEO and organic website SEO?',
    answer:
      'Google Map Pack SEO focuses on the localized 3-Pack box displayed at the top of local search results, driven by your Google Business Profile, geographic proximity, citations, and reviews. Organic website SEO focuses on the traditional search listings beneath the map, driven by technical site speed, deep content silos, structured data, and high-authority backlinks. A successful campaign optimizes both layers in unison.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technical',
    question: 'What is technical SEO and why is it essential for Cleveland businesses?',
    answer:
      'Technical SEO optimizes site architecture, mobile responsiveness, server speed, Core Web Vitals, and structured JSON-LD schema markup. Without a strong technical foundation, Google and AI search engines cannot crawl or rank your content effectively.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technical',
    question: 'How do you optimize Cleveland websites for Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT search?',
    answer:
      'We format content using answer-first prose, authoritative factual data, structured schema entities, and clean semantic HTML. This enables AI search engines like Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, and Google AI Overviews to parse and quote your brand directly.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technical',
    question: 'Why does website loading speed directly impact Google search rankings?',
    answer:
      'Google utilizes Core Web Vitals as an official ranking metric. Fast-loading websites deliver superior user experiences, resulting in lower bounce rates and higher session engagement. If your site takes longer than two seconds to load on mobile networks, search algorithms demote your listings in favor of faster competitors.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technical',
    question: 'What structured data schema do you implement on local Cleveland websites?',
    answer:
      'We deploy comprehensive JSON-LD schemas tailored to your industry, including LocalBusiness, ProfessionalService, MedicalClinic, LegalService, FAQPage, BreadcrumbList, and Service schemas. These structured data tags explicitly inform search bots about your geographic service boundaries, business hours, service offerings, and verified customer reviews.',
  },
  {
    category: 'timeline',
    question: 'How long does it take to see organic ranking improvements in Cleveland?',
    answer:
      'Initial technical fixes and low-competition neighborhood keyword wins typically show results within 45 to 60 days. Competitive high-volume head terms and stable top-3 Map Pack placements generally mature within 3 to 6 months of continuous optimization.',
  },
  {
    category: 'timeline',
    question: 'How do you track and report SEO return on investment (ROI)?',
    answer:
      'We track real commercial outcomes: phone call leads, form submissions, online appointment bookings, and organic revenue via custom Google Analytics 4 event tracking and Google Search Console data.',
  },
  {
    category: 'timeline',
    question: 'Will algorithm updates from Google disrupt our search rankings?',
    answer:
      'Google algorithm updates penalize websites that rely on manipulative shortcuts like artificial link networks and thin automated copy. Because our methodology is rooted in senior technical engineering, clean site architecture, authentic local citations, and deep original content, our client websites consistently gain ranking authority during core search updates.',
  },
  {
    category: 'timeline',
    question: 'Can SEO replace our paid Google Ads spend in Cleveland?',
    answer:
      'Yes, over time. While Google Ads provide immediate visibility for a continuous pay-per-click fee, organic SEO builds permanent digital equity. As your organic rankings and Map Pack positions solidify, most Cleveland clients systematically reduce their paid advertising budgets while maintaining a steady flow of qualified inbound leads.',
