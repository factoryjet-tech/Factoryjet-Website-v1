  },

    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'Do you offer payment plans for the development cost?',
    answer:
      'Yes. All plans can be split 50% upfront and 50% on launch day. Growth and Custom plans can be structured as 40-30-30 across the build. We accept NEFT, RTGS, UPI, and all major credit cards. No interest or fees are charged on installment plans — it is simply a split of the quoted fixed price.',
  },
  {
    category: 'pricing',
    question: 'What happens if my store is not ready in 7 days?',
    answer:
      'If we miss the 7-day deadline for reasons within our control, we refund 20% of the project value automatically — no questions asked. We have delivered on time for 97% of all builds. The remaining 3% delays are almost always due to client-side delays in providing product images, content, or payment gateway credentials — which we flag upfront in the onboarding checklist.',
  },

  /* ── Platform & Tech ── */
  {
    category: 'platform',
    question: 'Which ecommerce platform is right for my Lucknow business?',
    answer:
      'Shopify is the best default for most Lucknow D2C and B2C brands — fast to launch, easy to manage, and natively supports Razorpay, PayU, and UPI. WooCommerce is the right choice when you are already on WordPress or need deep content-commerce integration (recipes, guides, editorial content). Custom Next.js platforms make sense for high-volume D2C brands, B2B wholesale portals with complex pricing rules, or multi-vendor marketplaces where Shopify and WooCommerce hit their ceiling. FactoryJet makes this recommendation during discovery at no charge.',
  },
  {
    category: 'platform',
    question: 'Do you set up Razorpay, UPI, and Cash on Delivery for all stores?',
    answer:
      'Yes — all India payment methods are configured in every plan. Razorpay is our primary gateway and covers UPI, net banking, cards, wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, Mobikwik), EMI on major cards, and BNPL (LazyPay, Simpl). We also integrate PayU, CCAvenue, or PhonePe Business if you have an existing relationship. Cash on Delivery is configured with prepaid-to-COD ratios you control. Razorpay\'s fraud detection rules are configured at launch to keep COD abuse low.',
  },
  {
    category: 'platform',
    question: 'Can you connect my Lucknow store to Amazon India and Flipkart?',
    answer:
      'Yes — this is included in the Growth plan and above. We use Cedcommerce or Unicommerce to sync your product catalogue, pricing, and inventory between your Shopify or WooCommerce store and your Amazon India and Flipkart seller accounts. Orders from all channels flow into one dashboard. When stock sells on Amazon, it is deducted from your store automatically — no overselling.',
  },
  {
    category: 'platform',
    question: 'Can you set up WhatsApp Commerce and automated order flows?',
    answer:
      'Yes. We integrate WhatsApp Business API via Interakt, Wati, or AiSensy to send order confirmations, shipping updates, and abandoned cart messages on WhatsApp — open rates are 85%+ versus email\'s 20%. We also build conversational product discovery chatbots where customers browse and order directly in WhatsApp, with Razorpay payment links sent in-chat. This is included in Growth and Custom plans.',
  },

  /* ── India-Specific ── */
  {
    category: 'india',
    question: 'Do your stores support GST invoicing and compliance?',
    answer:
      'Yes — GST compliance is built into every Indian ecommerce store we deliver. This includes auto-generated GST invoices at order placement, GSTIN capture at checkout for B2B buyers, HSN code mapping per product category, state-wise IGST/CGST/SGST rate configuration, and monthly GSTR-1 export compatibility. We integrate with Tally, Zoho Books, or custom accounting exports on request.',
  },
  {
    category: 'india',
    question: 'Which logistics partner should I use for a Lucknow store?',
    answer:
      'Shiprocket is our default recommendation for most Lucknow ecommerce stores — it gives you access to Delhivery, Bluedart, XpressBees, Ekart, and Shadowfax under one integration, with automated NDR workflows, returns management, and weight dispute resolution. Delhivery directly via API is better for high-volume brands (10,000+ shipments per month) needing custom SLAs. For hyperlocal same-day delivery in Lucknow, Dunzo and Shadowfax are the right fit.',
  },
  {
    category: 'india',
    question: 'Can you add Hindi or Urdu language support to my store?',
    answer:
      'Yes — multi-language support is available for all platforms. For Shopify we use the Translate & Adapt app or Langify for regional language storefronts. For WooCommerce we implement WPML or TranslatePress. For custom platforms we build the i18n layer natively. Language-switched URLs follow SEO-safe hreflang patterns. We have built stores in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, and Bengali.',
  },
  {
    category: 'india',
    question: 'How do you handle cart abandonment for Indian shoppers?',
    answer:
      'India has a 78% cart abandonment rate — higher than global averages because COD hesitancy and payment UX friction are common. We build a 3-touch recovery sequence: 1) WhatsApp message within 30 minutes with a direct Razorpay payment link, 2) SMS at 2 hours with a small discount, 3) email at 24 hours with a trust signal (reviews, return policy). Stores with this sequence recover 18–22% of abandoned carts on average.',
  },

  /* ── Speed & SEO ── */
  {
    category: 'seo',
    question: 'Will my Lucknow ecommerce store rank on Google?',
    answer:
      'Every store we build includes technical SEO from day one: Product and BreadcrumbList schema for Google Shopping eligibility, optimised title and meta templates, canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content (a common Shopify and WooCommerce issue), GST price display, Core Web Vitals green on mobile, and sitemap submission to Google Search Console. LocalBusiness schema with Lucknow geo-coordinates is included for local search visibility.',
  },
  {
    category: 'seo',
    question: 'Do you guarantee a Lighthouse score?',
    answer:
      'Yes — Lighthouse 90+ on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO is a contractual commitment on all builds. We achieve this by serving WebP images from CDN, deferring non-critical JavaScript, inlining critical CSS, using next-gen fonts with preload, and hosting on Cloudflare Pages with assets served from the nearest edge node to your customer. We QA the score before handover and fix any regression post-launch within 48 hours at no charge.',
  },
  {
    category: 'seo',
    question: 'What are Core Web Vitals and why do they matter for my store?',
    answer:
      'Core Web Vitals are Google\'s three page experience signals: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint — how fast the main content loads, target under 2.5s), INP (Interaction to Next Paint — how fast the page responds to clicks, target under 200ms), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift — whether elements jump around, target below 0.1). Google confirmed these are a ranking signal. More importantly, a 1-second delay in mobile load time reduces conversion rates by 20%. For a store doing ₹50 lakh per month, that is ₹10 lakh in lost revenue every second of slowness.',
  },
  {
    category: 'seo',
    question: 'Can you optimise an existing Lucknow store that is already slow?',
    answer:
      'Yes — we offer a standalone Speed & SEO Audit + Fix package. We diagnose all Lighthouse failures, compress and convert your image library to WebP, remove render-blocking resources, fix CLS issues from unloaded fonts or images, and migrate your hosting to Cloudflare if needed. Most stores see a 30–60 point Lighthouse improvement within one sprint. We issue a written commitment: if we do not reach Lighthouse 90+ overall, we continue working at no additional charge.',
  },

  /* ── Process & Ownership ── */
  {
    category: 'trust',
    question: 'Do I own my store and all the code after launch?',
    answer:
      '100% yes. On launch day we transfer full ownership of the store account, the theme code, all integrations, and every custom component we built. You get GitHub repository access for all code assets and full admin credentials for every tool. We do not hold your store with ongoing fees. You can take the store to any developer after handover — we encourage it. What we hope is that you come back to us for the next phase.',
  },
  {
    category: 'trust',
    question: 'What does the handover process look like?',
    answer:
      'Day 7 is handover day. We schedule a 60–90 minute Zoom walkthrough covering: admin panel navigation, adding and editing products, processing orders, managing discounts, viewing analytics, and handling basic shipping issues. We deliver a handover document with all credentials, API keys, support contacts for each integration, and a first-30-days checklist. Post-handover, we are available on WhatsApp for 30 days for quick questions at no charge.',
  },
  {
    category: 'trust',
    question: 'Do you offer post-launch maintenance for Lucknow stores?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Our Care Plan covers plugin and platform updates, a monthly Lighthouse audit and performance fixes, uptime monitoring, a few hours of content or feature changes each month, and priority support with a 4-hour response SLA. Our Growth Retainer adds monthly A/B tests, conversion optimization, and new campaign landing pages. Both are month-to-month with no lock-in, and we share the exact monthly price on your free call.',
  },
  {
    category: 'trust',
    question: 'Can I manage and update the store myself after launch?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely — self-management is the goal. For Shopify stores, adding products, updating prices, creating discount codes, and reviewing orders requires zero coding knowledge. WooCommerce is slightly more technical but we set up a simplified admin workflow for non-technical founders. We build a short video library covering the 10 most common tasks your team will perform, so you are not dependent on a developer for day-to-day operations.',

                The average Indian ecommerce store converts at 0.8–1.2%. The top quartile converts at
                3–5%. The difference is not the product — it is the store. Slow load times on 4G
                networks, a UPI checkout that requires too many steps, product pages that bury the buy
                button below three paragraphs of description, and a mobile layout that was clearly
                designed on a desktop. These are engineering and design problems, not marketing
                problems.

                FactoryJet designs every store around Indian consumer behaviour: where the UPI button
                goes, when the WhatsApp chat trigger fires, how the mobile product page stacks on a
                375px screen, what trust signals appear above the fold, and how EMI is surfaced at
                checkout. We have built 120+ Shopify stores and hundreds of WooCommerce and custom
                builds for Indian brands. That data informs every decision we make on the next one.
